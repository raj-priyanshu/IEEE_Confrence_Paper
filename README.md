>- Abstract:This paper presents the performance analysis of simultaneous AC-DC power transmission scheme under balanced and unbalanced loading conditions. Simulation and experimentation based verification of simultaneous AC-DC power transmission scheme is already discussed in detail in literature. However, available literature dose not discuss the performance of this scheme under different load conditions which is most likely to occur in a practical power system. Zig-Zag transformer, which is a fundamental component of simultaneous AC-DC transmission scheme, behaves differently under balanced and unbalanced load situations. So, the validity of above discussed scheme for power transmission needs to be analyzed under different load conditions. This paper presents MATLAB/Simulink based analysis of simultaneous AC-DC transmission system under balanced and unbalanced load conditions.

>-Description: Designing of the high efficiency high density LLC Converter and simulating and analyzingthe same in Simulink.
>-Abstract: This paper discusses the design and analysis of a 380/12 V DC-DC high efficient LLC converter having a power output of 750W. The ripple in output voltage is brought down to 0.09V. It works with an efficiency of 96.1 percent at full load, 97.2 percent efficiency at 50 percent load and 91.2 percent efficiency at 10 percent load. Since zero voltage and zero current switching are used, losses are reduced significantly. The step by step design procedure has been explained and finally a mathematical model has been proposed with results taken from simulations.
